{"name":"Gzip","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gzip.git","body":"This is the file README for the gzip distribution.\r\n\r\nThe GNU gzip home page is http://www.gnu.org/software/gzip.\r\n\r\ngzip (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement\r\nfor 'compress'. Its main advantages over compress are much better\r\ncompression and freedom from patented algorithms.  The GNU Project\r\nuses it as the standard compression program for its system.\r\n\r\ngzip currently uses by default the LZ77 algorithm used in zip 1.9 (the\r\nportable pkzip compatible archiver). The gzip format was however\r\ndesigned to accommodate several compression algorithms. See below\r\nfor a comparison of zip and gzip.\r\n\r\ngunzip can currently decompress files created by gzip, compress or\r\npack. The detection of the input format is automatic.  For the\r\ngzip format, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack, gunzip checks the\r\nuncompressed length.  The 'compress' format was not designed to allow\r\nconsistency checks. However gunzip is sometimes able to detect a bad\r\n.Z file because there is some redundancy in the .Z compression format.\r\nIf you get an error when uncompressing a .Z file, do not assume that\r\nthe .Z file is correct simply because the standard uncompress does not\r\ncomplain.  This generally means that the standard uncompress does not\r\ncheck its input, and happily generates garbage output.\r\n\r\ngzip produces files with a .gz extension. Previous versions of gzip\r\nused the .z extension, which was already used by the 'pack'\r\nHuffman encoder. gunzip is able to decompress .z files (packed\r\nor gzip'ed).\r\n\r\nSeveral planned features are not yet supported (see the file TODO).\r\nSee the file NEWS for a summary of changes since the last release.\r\nSee the file INSTALL for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nWARNING: gzip is sensitive to compiler bugs, particularly when\r\noptimizing.  Use \"make check\" to check that gzip was compiled\r\ncorrectly.  Try compiling gzip without any optimization if you have a\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nPlease send all comments and bug reports by electronic mail to\r\n<bug-gzip@gnu.org>.\r\n\r\nBug reports should ideally include:\r\n\r\n    * The complete output of \"gzip -V\" (or the contents of revision.h\r\n      if you can't get gzip to compile)\r\n    * The hardware and operating system (try \"uname -a\")\r\n    * The compiler used to compile (if it is gcc, use \"gcc -v\")\r\n    * A description of the bug behavior\r\n    * The input to gzip, that triggered the bug\r\n\r\nIf you send me patches for machines I don't have access to, please test them\r\nvery carefully. gzip is used for backups, it must be extremely reliable.\r\n\r\nThe znew and gzexe shell scripts provided with gzip benefit from\r\n(but do not require) the (non-GNU) cpmod utility to transfer file attributes.\r\n\r\nThe sample programs zread.c, sub.c and add.c in subdirectory sample\r\nare provided as examples of useful complements to gzip. Read the\r\ncomments inside each source file.  The perl script ztouch is also\r\nprovided as example (not installed by default since it relies on perl).\r\n\r\n\r\ngzip is free software, you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\r\nthe terms of the GNU General Public License, a copy of which is\r\nprovided under the name COPYING. The latest version of gzip are always\r\navailable from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip or in any of the gnu\r\nmirror sites.\r\n\r\n- sources in gzip-*.tar (or .shar or .tar.gz).\r\n- MSDOS lha self-extracting exe in gzip-msdos-*.exe. Once extracted,\r\n  copy gzip.exe to gunzip.exe and zcat.exe, or use \"gzip -d\" to decompress.\r\n  gzip386.exe runs much faster but only on 386 and above; it was compiled with\r\n  djgpp 1.10 available in directory omnigate.clarkson.edu:/pub/msdos/djgpp.\r\n\r\nA VMS executable is in ftp://ftp.spc.edu/[.macro32.savesets]gzip-1-*.zip\r\n(use [.macro32]unzip.exe to extract). A PRIMOS executable is available\r\nin ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/primos/run/gzip.run.\r\n\r\nSome ftp servers can automatically make a tar.Z from a tar file. If\r\nyou are getting gzip for the first time, you can ask for a tar.Z file\r\ninstead of the much larger tar file.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to those who provided me with bug reports and feedback.\r\nSee the files THANKS and ChangeLog for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Note about zip vs. gzip:\r\n\r\nThe name 'gzip' was a very unfortunate choice, because zip and gzip\r\nare two really different programs, although the actual compression and\r\ndecompression sources were written by the same persons. A different\r\nname should have been used for gzip, but it is too late to change now.\r\n\r\nzip is an archiver: it compresses several files into a single archive\r\nfile. gzip is a simple compressor: each file is compressed separately.\r\nBoth share the same compression and decompression code for the\r\n'deflate' method.  unzip can also decompress old zip archives\r\n(implode, shrink and reduce methods). gunzip can also decompress files\r\ncreated by compress and pack. zip 1.9 and gzip do not support\r\ncompression methods other than deflation. (zip 1.0 supports shrink and\r\nimplode). Better compression methods may be added in future versions\r\nof gzip. zip will always stick to absolute compatibility with pkzip,\r\nit is thus constrained by PKWare, which is a commercial company.  The\r\ngzip header format is deliberately different from that of pkzip to\r\navoid such a constraint.\r\n\r\nOn Unix, gzip is mostly useful in combination with tar. GNU tar\r\n1.11.2 and later has a -z option to invoke gzip automatically.  \"tar -z\"\r\ncompresses better than zip, since gzip can then take advantage of\r\nredundancy between distinct files. The drawback is that you must\r\nscan the whole tar.gz file in order to extract a single file near\r\nthe end; unzip can directly seek to the end of the zip file. There\r\nis no overhead when you extract the whole archive anyway.\r\nIf a member of a .zip archive is damaged, other files can still\r\nbe recovered. If a .tar.gz file is damaged, files beyond the failure\r\npoint cannot be recovered. (Future versions of gzip will have\r\nerror recovery features.)\r\n\r\ngzip and gunzip are distributed as a single program. zip and unzip\r\nare, for historical reasons, two separate programs, although the\r\nauthors of these two programs work closely together in the Info-ZIP\r\nteam. zip and unzip are not associated with the GNU project.\r\nSee http://info-zip.org/ for more about zip and unzip.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor any copyright year range specified as YYYY-ZZZZ in this package\r\nnote that the range specifies every single year in that closed interval.\r\n\r\n========================================================================\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 1999, 2001-2002, 2006-2007, 2009-2013 Free Software Foundation,\r\nInc.\r\nCopyright (C) 1992, 1993 Jean-loup Gailly\r\n\r\nPermission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document\r\nunder the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or\r\nany later version published by the Free Software Foundation; with no\r\nInvariant Sections, with no Front-Cover Texts, and with no Back-Cover\r\nTexts.
